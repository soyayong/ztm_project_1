            <p class="font-roboto font-light text-gray-500 text-lg py-6 px-5">

                and Bachelor of Mechatronic Engineering at University Malaysia Pahang,

            </p>
            <p class="font-roboto font-light text-gray-500 text-lg py-6 px-5">
                Experienced as a full-stack developer using LabVIEW, Data Engineer like ETL skill, indexes, query, and performance in MSSQL.
                Besides that, a data analyst skill set applies and uses BI tools like Qlik Sense and Power BI for visualization in the
                Shimano company from 2017 until 2021 August. In 2021 August a data science career path under MC Crenergy company as a contract base.
                While 2022 joined my current company as BI developer.
            </p>
            <p class="font-roboto font-light text-gray-500 text-lg py-6 px-5">
                Based on those experiences that I pass through, I can say that I'm quite good in those skills like LabVIEW,
                SQL(query, indexes, performance tuning, and dynamic SQL), Master Data Management,
                BI Tools(Qlik Sense started in 2018, PowerBI started in 2019, and Tableau started in 2021),
                Python, ETL tools, and basic javascript.
            </p>
            <p class="font-roboto font-light text-gray-500 text-lg py-6 px-5">
                Apart from that, I found that self-education is most important to growing my knowledge.
                So starting from 2018 to improve developer skills such as SQL Server, Data Science,
                Web Development (Javascript and ReactJS), and BI tools.
                My future career plan is to become a full stack in data science.
            </p>
            <p class="font-roboto font-light text-gray-500 text-lg py-6 px-5">
                Lastly, the most important thing is to apply soft skills like self-motivation,
                teamwork, responsibility, problem-solving, communication, leadership,
                able to work under pressure, and well time management in my life or working area.
